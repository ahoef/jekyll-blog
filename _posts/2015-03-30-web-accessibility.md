excerpt:  In the back of my mind, I've always known that the websites I've done for fun and for work probably have had some range of accessibility issues. Last night, I took a class on the topic and learned how to run an accessibility audit on sites. The results were... scary!

If you're at all like me, this is what your experience is like when you first start learning about web accessibility:

<ol>
	<li>Check out your site on a screen reader</li>
	<li>Freak out at how bad it is</li>
	<li>Open 300 tabs and research all the things</li>
	<li>Take some steps to fix it</li>
</ol>
