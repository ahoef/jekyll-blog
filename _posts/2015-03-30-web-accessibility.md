excerpt:  In the back of my mind, I've always known that the websites I've done for fun and for work probably have had some range of accessibility issues. Last night, I took a class on the topic and learned how to run an accessibility audit on sites. The results were... scary! But thankfully, not so hard to fix.

If you're at all like me, this is what your experience is like when you first start learning about web accessibility:

<ol>
	<li>Check out your site on a screen reader</li>
	<li>Freak out at how bad it is</li>
	<li>Open 300 tabs and research all the things</li>
	<li>Take some steps to fix it</li>
</ol>

Last night I took a GDI class on the topic, taught by my friend LeeAnn, so all of this is fresh on my mind! In the class, LeeAnn provided a wealth of information about accessibility best practices, as well as an extensive list of tools to test and improve code for better accessibility.

A few key takeaways-

<ul>
	<li>Web Accessibility doesn't just mean accommodating blind or deaf users 
		<ul>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Writing semantic markup gets you lots of accessibility, basically for free</li>
	<li>Experiencing a site via a screen reader and auditing for accessibility should not be a one-off task; it should be built into regular maintenance and QA</li>
	<li>Accessibility does impact the bottom line
		<ul>
			<li>Obviously, no one will buy anything from a site they can't use</li>
			<li>Some countries (Canada & Australia) require accessibility by law, and some companies have been sued/fined for infringement</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
