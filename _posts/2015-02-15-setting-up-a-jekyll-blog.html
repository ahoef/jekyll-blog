	<h1>Setting Up A Jekyll Blog</h1>

	<div class="headline">Hello World</div>

	<p>Before setting up this blog, my past blogging experience has only been with Wordpress. Jekyll has turned out to be a real a breath of fresh air over the clunky workflow of plugins, MAMP, databases, enqueuing, and all the rest of Wordpress. While a powerful CMS with a non-technical interface and database storage is super useful in some situations, it's easy to see how it can be overkill for other situations. </p>
